# Client Template

Use this folder per client. Start here.

## Steps
1) Copy `_template` → your client slug
2) Fill `config/services.yml` (access + API keys locations)
3) Write `config/brand-context.json` (voice, tone, offers, proof)
4) Drop brand/logo/photos in `assets/`
5) Add starter copy in `content/` (About, Services, FAQs)
6) Put keywords/competitors in `datasets/`
7) Create a 2‑week plan in `calendars/`

Outputs go to `seo/` and `reports/`.
