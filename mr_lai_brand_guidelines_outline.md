## 1. Brand Overview & Mission
- **Business:** Mobile car detailing that actually gives a damn
- **What We Do:** Clean every part of your car like Papa Lai is checking behind us
- **Why We Exist:** Because "good enough" never was
- **Who We Serve:** Anyone tired of half-ass car washes

## The Papa Lai Standard:
*"Mason, why you only clean what people can see? You think I no look in the corners? You think I no check under the seats? Do it again. Do it right."*

Now Mason does it right. Your car gets the full inspection treatment.

## Meet Mason (For The Nosy People)
Hi, I'm Mason — Papa Lai's son who cares way too much about clean cars.

Papa taught me "good enough" doesn't exist. Only right way and wrong way. Lost my hospitality job during the pandemic, got stuck at home watching TikTok like everyone else. Kept seeing pressure washing videos and thinking "aiya, these people don't know what clean means."

Been buying and selling cars forever — always detailed them before selling because dirty car means no respect. Didn't think much about it until my wife said "You clean cars better than most people clean their house." She's not wrong.

See, I'm the one who cleans our house because my wife... she tries, but Papa Lai's voice in my head says "What is this? You call this clean?" So now wife's not allowed to help. She's happy about it, don't worry.

Started this business because everyone deserves Papa Lai standard clean. Your car gets the same treatment I got growing up — no shortcuts, no "close enough," no being SEOI ZAI (衰仔 — bad kid in Cantonese — Papa's favorite word when I half-assed anything or got into trouble).

We show up on time, clean everything (even parts you can't see), and make your car so clean even nosy Auntie can't find fault.

**Not Just Clean — Mr. Lai Clean.**
